step 1, figure out why the page is ugly (hint, look for the filename of the cascading style sheet (css) in the "head" of your source code...something is wrong with it.
<p>optional step if you want to add colors:<br>
colors are encoded as a hash # followed by 6 digits. #000000 the first two digits are red, the second pair are green, the third pair are blue. lets try changing the background color using the .css file. Open the css file in TextPad. The code in the .css wont look familiar. Cascading style sheets use another type of language than html, they use the "css" language. You don't need to learn much about css. Lets just change the <p>

background-color: #FFFFFF

<p>to background-color: #FF0000; what happened? the background turned red. now try #00ff00, #0000ff. What color is #000000? These colors work like light (not pigment). If all the colors are strong (FF) then you get white, if all the colors are weak, then you get black. Here is the scale (after 9 it goes to letters)<p>

0123456789abcdef<br>
darkest - > brightest
<p>

Try #cccccc #000044 #ccccff

<p>Experiment with different combinations in the 6 digits to find a color you like. If you are familiar with PhotoShop or other photo editing applications you can select a color using their color wheel and they will give you the webpage code for it.

<p>optional step if you want to "hide" something:<br>
if you have some source code that you want to use later, but that you don't want to be displayed now you can comment it out. The way to make comments in html is to put < ! - - before the text, and - - > after it. Look in the code to see an example <!--of a comment i made-->. For example, if you don't have research pages that you want to publish right now you can comment that section out without loosing the code.

final step, make the table border 0 so that the ugly lines disappear, and delete this line, then upload your website.
